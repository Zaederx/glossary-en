= Variable

A datatype that stores values which are likely to change as your program runs. A variableâ€™s type depends on the type of information you want to store, and the maximum size of the information; for example, a byte can store up to 256 different values, but an int can store up t 65,536 different values. Variables can be local to a particular block of code, or global to an entire program. (see Global variable, Local variable).
