Transducers are device that can perform an input (Sensors) or an output (Actuators) function. For example a force sensor converts the physical change into an electrical signal, an actuator transforms an electrical signal into a physical change like movement or sound.
Another example of transducers are the microphone that converts sound waves into electrical signal, or a loudspeaker that converts this electrical signal back into sound waves.
