= Calibration

The process of making adjustments to certain numbers or components to get the best results from a circuit or program. <!--more-->In Arduino projects, this is often used when sensors in the real world may give different values in different circumstances, for instance the amount of light on a photoresistor. Calibration can be automatic or manual.
